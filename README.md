## What is Rexton Tournaments?

Rexton Tournaments is a platform that allows Rexton gaming and public members to participate and compete in league of legends tournaments. The platform will allow for users to join tournaments created by the app's game masters. Tournaments can be configured to have different maps, game modes, and game rules.

## What is this code for?

This code is for the web application that powers Rexton Tournaments. It includes the backend logic for managing tournaments, users, and tournaments. We're getting this app ready to be approved by riot games so that we can start hosting tournaments.

## Is my account secure if the app is open source?

Yes. While nothing is 100% secure, the app uses security measures to protect user data and game information integrity. It will only continue to improve and does not "give away" any information unauthorized parties can exploit directly.
